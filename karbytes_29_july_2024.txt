I "smoked" the remnants of a cannabis cartridge while standing in the shade of some trees and buildings near the train tracks and freeway at the "border" of Sunnyvale and Mountain View at approximately 3:30PM Pacific Standard Time beneath a clear blue sky and while surrounded by the sound of commute traffic, human activity, and the leaves rustling in the moderate and steady breeze. The following thoughts were coursing through my mind:

"Entropy is (seemingly) inescapable. Therefore, (presumably) nothing is safe from being annihilated at any (future) point in that thing's existential timeline (except for pure nothingness (which means that (perhaps) only pure nothingness is safe from being deleted or altered as a consequence of becoming older))."

"Perhaps no object except for pure nothingness is guaranteed to exist for an infinitely long time (and at all times)."
