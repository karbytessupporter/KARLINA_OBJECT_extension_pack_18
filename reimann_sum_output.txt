Enter the number which corresponds with one of the following functions:

0 --> f(x) = x^2

1 --> f(x) = x^3

2 --> f(x) = sin(x)

3 --> f(x) = cos(x)

4 --> f(x) = sqrt(x)

5 --> f(x) = 2x + 3

Enter Option Here: 

The value which was entered for option is -11.

option was set to 0 by default due to the fact that the value input by the user was not recognized.

The single-variable function which was selected from the list of such functions is f(x) = x^2.

--------------------------------

Enter a value to store in double-type variable a (which represents the left end of the x-axis interval): 

The value which was entered for a is 21.

Enter a value to store in double-type variable b (which represents the right end of the x-axis interval): 

The value which was entered for b is 33.

Enter a value to store in int-type variable n (which represents the number of equally-sized partitions to divide x-axis interval [a,b] into): 

The value which was entered for n is 666.

The x-axis interval which was selected to partition is [21,33].

The selected number of equally-sized partitions to divide that interval into is 666.

--------------------------------

Enter the number which corresponds with one of the following rectangle construction methods:

0 --> "left"

1 --> "right"

2 --> "midpoint"

Enter Option Here: 

The value which was entered for option is 6.

option was set to 0 by default due to the fact that the value input by the user was not recognized.

The rectangle construction method which was selected from the list of such methods is "left" (i.e. using the left end-point of each of the n partitions of [a,b] to set the height of each of the n rectangles).
