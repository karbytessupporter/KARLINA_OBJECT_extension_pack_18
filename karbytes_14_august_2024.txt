During the first four years’ of karbytes’ instantiation (in the form of ALL files comprising the public websites named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com AND referenced by at least one web page of the two aforementioned websites AND hosted as a source code file (with a referencing hyperlink whose text color is GREEN and whose background color is BLACK) xor as a media file (with a referencing hyperlink whose text color is ORANGE and whose background color is BLACK) on a public GitHub repository whose sole creator and owner is karbytes (using the GitHub username @karlinarayberinger)), karbytes knowingly performed some actions which karbytes thought were “legally ambiguous” (i.e. not explicitly LEGAL and likely something the committer of such actions could be legally (i.e. with the government’s permission and coercion) penalized for). Those actions amount almost exclusively to (if not exclusively to) taking screenshots of (at least now) private Instagram posts which karbytes’ Instagram account (i.e. @karbytes_anew) had been granted follow access to (and then incorporating that image into the karbytes intellectual property “cloud-hosted” collection (which karbytes has declared every file of as being PUBLIC_DOMAIN)), downloading videos from YouTube which contain whole songs karbytes’ did not produce or have explicit permission from the legal proprietors of that intellectual property to download (and then incorporating that video into the karbytes intellectual property “cloud-hosted” collection (which karbytes has declared every file of as being PUBLIC_DOMAIN)), and sharing (in plain-text form) phone numbers of people karbytes has considered to be close family or friends in at least one file of the aforementioned body of intellectual property referred to by the author of this note (i.e. karbytes) as karbytes.

As of 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 14_AUGUST_2024, karbytes has no plans of making changes to address the “legal gray area” matters broached in this note. karbytes believes that those matters do not pose a serious threat to any person’s livelihood, safety, or well-being and that those controversially-included files into the (allegedly (according to karbytes)) public domain (and open source) karbytes were included for nostalgic, artistic, and educational purposes which add to the overall richness and comprehensiveness of human-generared and/or human-curated public World Wide Web based content. karbytes does not expect any person to attempt to persecute karbytes for any action which karbytes committed prior to 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 14_AUGUST_2024. karbytes also thinks karbytes is likely to evade being persecuted for any crime for the vast majority of karbytes’ total lifespan. karbytes is passionately devoted to preserving, expanding, and enjoying the World Wide Web and computational technology in general and allowing as many other people as possible (ideally ALL people) to also passionately devote themselves to such endeavors if those people really want to.
