Last night (or, more accurately, earlier this morning), I dreamt that I ran into SED in public and we immediately hugged and he offered immediately after to go on a quick car ride with him to talk one on one. The dream progressed to me sitting in the front passenger seat while SED was in the driver seat (and it was his old blue Volkswagen station wagon and not his newer blue Tesla Model 3 or S).

It may very well be the case that the government "implanted" that particular dream in my sleeping brain. I have assumed that such was the case with many particularly vivid "movie quality" (and thematically "dark" and ("darkly humorous")) dreams I had. Approximately two nights ago, I had what I also suspected could very likely be a "government-induced dream" which featured an adolescent jaguar laying on its back with its front paws gently pawing the air (either playfully or possibly in awe) with its eye sockets filled with surrealist slow-moving fire and then traveling downward further into the cranium to reveal an illuminated "candle wick" structure in each eye socket with soft glowing orange flames traveling deeper into the body. There seemed to be scintillating particles reminiscent of sparks from a bon fire slowly moving across the scene which was a closeup of the jaguar's face (and the backdrop appeared to be a desolate darkened room or nocturnal outdoor location. A final important detail I remember about that dream was hearing some young to middle-aged man's voice (at the start of that dream sequence) say, "Hey, come check this out," but I do not remember either me or whoever that voice-source was having tangibly finite bodies.

The significance of today's note was originally assumed by karbytes to be about the following idea karbytes had (and that idea is a hypothesis): deep down, and no matter who it is, every person is always omniscient and always (relative to its embodied frames of reference (due to physics being a constraint on otherwise boundless "free will")) omnipotent.
